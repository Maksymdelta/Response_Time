================================================
SUMMARY:

This directory is for the PRAAT script for automatically taking a directory
of wav files, and generating a corresponding .TextGrid file annotated with
silences.  Hopefully, we will add functionality for extracting other features
with PRAAT.

GridMaker.praat  - this is the script file

Running the script in praat with default params will cause a root.TextGrid file
to be created for every *.wav file.

================================================
DETAILED DIRECTIONS:

1. launch praat

    $ praat&

2. in the Praat Objects window, select menu item for opening a praat script

    Praat Objects 
         --> Praat --> Open Praat Script

3. select gridmaker.praat (after navigating to the right directory 
   with selection GUI.

4. In the Script window, select Run

    Script 
       --> Run --> Run

5. adjust Directory if necessary
     The directory is the location where all of the .wav files should be.

6. adjust Filename initial substring
     Only file which start with the substring will be processed

     **I'm not sure what tiers does

7. click ok
     While praat is processing, it will seem like praat has frozen. For 
     processing 42 files, it should take about thirty seconds on a decent 
     2016 desktop.
